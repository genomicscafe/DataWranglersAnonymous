## Calling all Genomics Researchers! Data Wranglers Anonymous Returns to the Genomics Cafe!

The Genomics Cafe is thrilled to announce the **bi-weekly** return of our popular **Data Wranglers Anonymous (DWA)** initiative! 

DWA is a **casual and supportive space** for researchers of all levels to gather and **troubleshoot their coding challenges** in a **low-stakes environment**. 

**Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting out**, DWA is the perfect place to:

* **Bring your burning coding questions:** Stuck on a specific line of code? Need help with a complex data wrangling task? DWA is your chance to get **peer-to-peer guidance** from fellow researchers who have faced similar challenges.
* **Share your coding projects:** Have a cool coding project in mind but unsure where to begin? DWA provides a platform to **share your ideas** and get **valuable feedback** from your peers.

**Important to remember:** DWA is **not a formal teaching session**. We believe that the best way to learn is through **collaborative problem-solving and shared experiences**. So, come prepared to **discuss your challenges, offer your expertise to others, and learn from your fellow data wranglers!**

**Sweeten the deal!** We'll be providing **snacks and candy** at every session to fuel your coding endeavors.

**Stay tuned for further announcements about the upcoming DWA sessions!** We can't wait to see you there!
